# ðŸŽ¯ Customer Personality & Segmentation Project  

## ðŸ“Œ Business Objective  
Customer personality analysis helps businesses understand customers better and modify products/marketing strategies based on **customer segments** instead of targeting everyone blindly.  

ðŸ‘‰ Example: Instead of marketing a new product to all customers, we identify the **most likely segment** and run targeted campaigns.
